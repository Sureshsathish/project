# PATH BREAKING AI FOR PROACTIVE POTHOLE IDENTIFICATION ON ROADS
This project proposes a novel and efficient method for automated pothole detection on roadways using the state-of-the-art object detection model, YOLOv8. By leveraging its real-time processing capabilities and high accuracy, the system effectively identifies potholes from images or video streams, providing a crucial tool for road maintenance authorities and autonomous vehicle systems.
## Project Overview
Potholes are a major challenge to road safety and infrastructure maintenance globally. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and inefficient for large road networks. This project addresses these limitations by developing an automated pothole detection system using deep learning.
The system is built on YOLOv8, the latest iteration of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) framework, known for its high accuracy and real-time processing. We fine-tuned the YOLOv8 architecture on a specialized, annotated dataset of potholes to ensure high precision and recall rates across various road and lighting conditions.
## Key Objectives:
Develop a robust and efficient pothole detection system using the YOLOv8 model.
Train the model on a curated dataset of annotated road images to ensure it generalizes well across diverse conditions.
Achieve high precision and recall rates by optimizing the model's performance.
Implement real-time processing capabilities to enable timely detection and response.
Evaluate the system's effectiveness through rigorous testing in different road scenarios.
## Methodology
Our methodology is a structured pipeline designed for optimal performance:
## Data Collection and Annotation: 
We gathered a diverse dataset of 10,000 images containing road surfaces with potholes. The images were meticulously annotated using segmentation to outline potholes with pixel-level accuracy.
## Data Preprocessing: 
Images were auto-oriented and resized to a uniform 640x640 pixels to ensure consistency and improve model learning. Data augmentation techniques like flipping and rotation were used to prevent overfitting and address class imbalance.
## Data Splitting: 
The dataset was partitioned into a training set (70%), a validation set (20%), and a testing set (10%).
## Model Training: 
The YOLOv8 model was trained on the augmented training dataset. The model learned to map input images to their annotations by minimizing the loss function.
## Model Evaluation: 
The model's performance was assessed using key metrics like mAP (Mean Average Precision), precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Results and Performance
The YOLOv8 model for pothole detection yielded exceptional results.
